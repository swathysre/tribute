<h2 class=" tesla">Early life of tesla</h2>
<p> Nikola Tesla was born in the croatian town of smilijan on 10 July in 1856 to a priest father.
<br>
Nikola Tesla  was a Serbian American inventor,electric engineer,mechanical engineer and futurist.
<br>
He is known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current(AC) electricity supply system.
<br>
Tesla first studied engineering and physics in 1870s without receiving a degree.He gained practical experience in early 1880s working in telephony and to a contenetal edison in the new electric power industry.
<br>
he worked  for a short time at the edison machine works in newyork city before he struck out on his own as an engineer.
<br>
</p>
<h2 class"tesla">Contributions and achivement </h2>
<ol>
<p><li>After moving to Newyork ,united states,he worked for a short time at the edison machine works as an engineer.
but the two did not get along well.</li>
<br>
<li>He started working with Georgia westinghouse in 1885.There he devised an electical distribution system that employed alternating current(AC).</li>

<br>
<li>Tesla made public the first successful wireless energy transfer to power electronic devices in 1891.</li>

<br>
<li>He is known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current(AC) electricity supply system.</li>

<br>
<li>the westinghouse electric company was the first to implement this technology by lightning the world colombia exposition in cchicagoin 1893.</li>

<br>
<li>Beside the AC system,Tesla helped in the development of generators and turbine design.
the earliest demonstration of fluroscent lighting was also his accomplishment.</li>

<br>
<li>tesla continued his research work on electricity generation and turbin design in the later life.</li>

<br>
<li>even at 81,he claimed to have completed a <strong>"DYNAMIC THEORY OF GRAVITY"</strong> something which was never published.</li>
 
<br>
</p>
<h2>Awards</h2>
<ul>
<p>Tesla received many awards and honour during his lifetime:
<br>
<li><strong>edison medal by the american institute of electric engineer.</strong></li>
<br>
<li><strong>inventors hall of fame induction.</strong></li>
<br>
<li><strong>the unit of magnetic flux density was named the "tesla" in his honour(1984).</strong></li>
<br>
<li><strong>nickola tesla was awarded the nobel prize for physics in 1912,together with thomas edison.
because of their feud,tesla rejected the prize which was then awarded to nils gustaf dalen.</strong></li>
</p>
<h2>Death</h2>
<p>tesla died of coronary thrombosis on january 7,1943 in newyork city.
